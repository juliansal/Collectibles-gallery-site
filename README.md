# Collectibles-gallery-site

This is a simple HTML site for posting your favorite collectible figures, or any other hobby collection you may have. I've included the design mockups I created in Adobe Illustrator in the planning stage of this project. This repo is meant to show the Front End work of the project, before I converted it into a WordPress theme.
